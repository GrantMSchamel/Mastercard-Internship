| Team          | Email Open Rate | Email Click-Through Rate | Phishing Success Rate |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| IT            | 80%             | 2%                       | 0%                    |
| HR            | 100%            | 85%                      | 75%                   |

| R&D           | 50%             | 5%                       | 2%                    |
| **Overall Average** | **66%** | **28%**                  | **18%**               |

### Observations:  
- **HR and Marketing** teams have the highest phishing success rates at **75%** and **38%**, respectively, highlighting the need for targeted security awareness training.  
- The **IT and Reception** teams demonstrated strong phishing awareness with a **0% phishing success rate**.  
- The **overall average phishing success rate** is **18%**, which indicates room for improvement across the organization.

### Recommendations:  
1. **Targeted Training for HR and Marketing:**  
   - Develop workshops focused on recognizing phishing emails.  
   - Use real-world phishing examples to increase engagement and understanding.  

2. **Organization-Wide Awareness Campaign:**  
   - Launch a company-wide email and poster campaign to reinforce security best practices.  
   - Include reminders about not clicking on suspicious links or sharing personal information.  

3. **Periodic Phishing Simulations:**  
   - Conduct regular phishing tests to measure improvement and identify emerging vulnerabilities.  
   - Share results with teams to keep awareness high.
