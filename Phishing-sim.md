# Phishing Email Simulation

This section demonstrates the phishing email simulation I created during the **Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Internship** as part of Task 1.

## Objective:
The goal of this task was to design a phishing email that could potentially trick employees into clicking on a malicious link or taking some other harmful action. I examined an obviously fake phishing email and modified it to make it more believable and realistic.

## Phishing Email Example

**Subject:** Action Required: Report IT Issues & Enter to Win a Free Meal  

**Dear Mastercard Team,**

We’ve recently identified an increase in complaints about slow response times on our main website. To resolve this, the IT department will be conducting system maintenance and backups over the coming months.

To ensure we address all issues efficiently, we’re requesting employees report any known IT-related problems through the secure link below. Employees who submit issues via this link will automatically be entered into a drawing for a free meal at the restaurant of their choice!

If you have questions or concerns, feel free to reply to this email.

Thank you for your cooperation!

**Mastercard Security Team**

## Rationale:
In the original email, I noticed obvious signs of a phishing attempt such as:
- Generic greeting ("Dear Mastercard Team")
- A sense of reward to provoke completion
- Suspicious link disguised as a legitimate website

I modified these elements to create a more believable version of the email, while maintaining key characteristics of phishing attacks:
- Used a professional tone and familiar language
- Included a seemingly legitimate call-to-action
- Crafted a convincing scenario involving IT improvement

By understanding how phishing emails work, I can help raise awareness and mitigate the risks they pose to organizations.
